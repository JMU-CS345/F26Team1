### Definition of Ready

*A backlog item may be pulled into a sprint only when:*

- [ ] it is written as a user story
- [ ] it has acceptance criteria
- [ ] it has an estimate

### Definition of Done

*An item is done only when:*

- [ ] code is reviewed and approved by at least one teammate
- [ ] all tests pass in CI
- [ ] merged to `main`
- [ ] works in the deployed build
- [ ] the issue is closed
- [ ]

### Estimation

**Method:** *(story points, t-shirt sizes, hours)*

**Scale:** *(e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)*

_

### Backlog and Board

**Where the backlog lives:** *(e.g., GitHub Projects board, link here)*

**Board columns:** *(e.g., To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done)*

_

## 3. Communication

### Primary Channel

**Channel:** *(Discord, Slack, GroupMe, ...)*

**Expected response time:** *(e.g., within 12 hours on weekdays)*

### What Goes Where

*(What is discussed in the chat channel vs. in GitHub issues vs. in PR comments?)*

_

### Reporting Blockers or Falling Behind

*(How and how early does a member tell the team they are stuck or behind?)*

_

### Absences

*(How much notice is required? How is the absent member's work covered?)*

_

---

## 4. Git and GitHub Workflow

### Branch Naming

**Format:** *(e.g., `type/issue-short-description`)*

**Allowed types:** *(e.g., `feature`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`)*

**Examples:**

-
-

### Branch Protection on `main`

- [ ] No direct pushes to `main`
- [ ] Required approvals before merge: _
- [ ] CI must pass before merge
- [ ] Same protection on `production`

### Commit Messages

*(Format and style, e.g., imperative mood: "Add rune puzzle validation". Do we follow Conventional Commits?)*

_

### Pull Requests

**Maximum size:** *(e.g., aim for under 300 changed lines)*

**Description template:** *(e.g., What / Why / How to test / Screenshot)*

**Linking issues:** *(e.g., every PR includes `Closes #N`)*

_

### Code Review

**Review turnaround:** *(e.g., within 24 hours of being requested)*

**Who reviews what:** *(e.g., any teammate; or a rotating assignment)*

_

### Merging

**Merge style:** *(merge commit, squash and merge, or rebase and merge)*

## 5. Code Conventions

### Naming

| Kind | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Variables and functions | | |
| Classes | | |
| Constants | | |
| Files | | |
| Test files | | |

### Formatting

**Indentation:** *(2 spaces, 4 spaces, tabs)*

**Semicolons:** *(always / never)*

**Quotes:** *(single / double)*

**Maximum line length:** _

**Tools:** *(e.g., Prettier and ESLint, with config files committed to the repo)*

_

### Project Structure

*(Where does each kind of file live?)*

```
src/
  model/        (e.g., game logic, no p5 drawing calls)
  view/         (e.g., drawing code)
  controller/   (e.g., input handling)
assets/
spec/
```

### Architecture Rules

*(e.g., game logic never calls p5 drawing functions directly, so it can be unit tested)*

-
-

### Comments and Documentation

*(When are comments or JSDoc required?)*

_

### Assets

**File naming:** *(e.g., all lowercase, hyphens, no spaces)*

_

---

## 6. Testing and Quality

**Test framework:** Jasmine

**Where tests live:** _

**What must have tests:** *(e.g., all model code; every bug fix gets a test that reproduces it; combat and puzzle rules)*

_

**Coverage expectations:** 90+%

**Continuous integration:** *(What does GitHub Actions run on each PR?)*

_

**Rule for failing CI:** *(e.g., nothing merges while CI is red)*

_

**Manual playtesting:** *(Who plays the build before each sprint review, and how are bugs reported?)*

_

---

## 7. Deployment

**Where the game is deployed:** GitHub Pages, URL here

**What triggers a deploy:** *(e.g., a release PR from `main` into `production`, opened by the Scrum Master after each sprint review)*

**Who checks the deployed build, and when:** _

---

## 8. AI Tool Usage

**Allowed tools:** _

**Allowed uses:** *(e.g., code generation, tests, documentation, review)*

_

**Not allowed:** _

**Disclosure:** *(e.g., note AI assistance in the PR description)*

## 9. Working Agreements and Conflict

### Expected Effort

_

### Conflict Resolution

*(What steps do we follow when there is a disagreement or a problem with a teammate?)*

1. *(e.g., talk to the person directly)*
2. *(e.g., raise it at the retrospective)*
3. *(e.g., Scrum Master mediates)*
4. *(e.g., escalate to the instructor)*

### Missed Commitments

*(What happens when a member repeatedly misses commitments?)*
